This report documents the full software development cycle used to extend an open-source autopilot product. The aim of this project was to add functionality to an existing autopilot aimed at UAVs to provide better navigation for the purposes of aerial photography. The system implemented is able to both plan a battery and time efficient route for a UAV to follow, and command a given UAV to fly it. Although both of these capabilities work well independently, this report explains the shortcomings of the system as a whole, as well as its more useful features and behaviours.
