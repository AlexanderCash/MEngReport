		ArduPilot and ArduPlane
		Hardware choices
		Motivations + objectives

	Lit Review; 
		Dubin's paths + path following in wind
		Dev wiki re: adding modes etc
	Part 1 - Route planning

add dubins commands into cmd->mavlink function in LatestPlane\ardupilot\libraries\AP_Mission\AP_Mission.cpp
Add print statements for commands to consol
add code to run and verify dummy command
