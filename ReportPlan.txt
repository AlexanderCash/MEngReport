Chapters
	Introduction; 
		intro to UAVs
		Aerial photography with UAVs
		ArduPilot and ArduPlane
		Hardware choices
		Motivations + objectives

	Lit Review; 
		Dubin's paths + path following in wind
		Dev wiki re: adding modes etc
	Part 1 - Route planning
		MATLAB methods - discuss package from andrew walker
		C++ conversion
		Resulting applications + testing procedures
			Describe the resulting algorithm and how it finds a suitable candidate
			Deficiencies in the code and how to improve it
	Part 2 - Autopilot Control
		Attempts at new flight modes
		New commands instead
		Error handling?
	Future work
		incorporation into MissionPlanner
		resilience to gusts - compare GPS+airspeed sensor to detect deviations
		Calculate on board the UAV
		?
	Planning
		Agile lol - task breakdown
		Discuss the elements of unknown
		Setbacks etc etc
	Conclusion
		A lot I would have done differently...
		What was good
		What was bad
		Moving forward
