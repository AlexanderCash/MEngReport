The following 4 figures are the results of the roll lag testing performed as part of the path planning task testing. The four configurations are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 65\degree  maximum roll angle, airspeed of 20 metres per second
	\item 65\degree  maximum roll angle, airspeed of 10 metres per second
	\item 32.5\degree  maximum roll angle, airspeed of 20 metres per second
	\item 32.5\degree  maximum roll angle, airspeed of 10 metres per second
\end{enumerate}

The figures appear in the order the configurations are listed here.
